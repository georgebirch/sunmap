# SolMap

A Dash/HTML website to plot the path of the sun relative to surround terrain

## Description

What time will the sun come out? On an autumn day in high alpine terrain, it might be in the afternoon - or not at all. The time and duration of sun exposure in the mountains is not obtainable through the normal mapping and weather services. SolMap provides this information through a simple, interactive dashboard. Finally, hikers, mountaineers, farmers and researchers can get instantly check sun exposure.
